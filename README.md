Write a class GenericUtils with a class method called reverse that takes an array of a generic type as a parameter. The method should flip this array (so that the first element is at the last and the last element first). The swapping should happen in-place, so no new array should be created.

Write a second class method Generic method called sum that takes an array of a generic type as a parameter. But in this instance the allowed types for this array should only be subclasses of the java.lang.Number-class (including java.lang.Number). Calculate the sum of all values in the Array and return the result as double.

Write a class with a main method, which tests the methods of the GenericUtilsclass.

Pay particular attention to:
Use English identifiers (aka names), write your comments in English and be prepared to make your assignment talk in English as well.
